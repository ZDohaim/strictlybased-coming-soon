        2. StrictlyBased LLC’s mission and independence 2.1. Purpose and mission
        StrictlyBased LLC SAS is a company with a mission, as defined by Article
        L.210-10 of the French Commercial Code. StrictlyBased LLC’s purpose is
        to make consumers aware of the composition of products, particularly
        food and cosmetics, in order to help them make better choices for their
        health and for the planet, while at the same time representing a lever
        for action to encourage companies to improve the transparency and
        quality of their products. StrictlyBased LLC’s mission, as defined by
        Article L.210-10 of the French Commercial Code, is to pursue the
        following social and environmental goals: (i) To make as many people as
        possible aware of the health, nutritional and environmental impact of
        products, particularly food and cosmetic products; (ii) To alert
        consumers to the potential risks that may result from the products they
        consume, particularly when these products contain ingredients, additives
        or components that are the subject of scientific controversy calling
        into question their use; (iii) To help consumers make better choices for
        their health and for the planet, by offering them independent
        alternatives that respect their health and/or environmental concerns;
        (iv) To encourage companies to improve the composition of their products
        in order to make these products healthier and more sustainable.
        StrictlyBased LLC accomplishes its mission mainly through the
        StrictlyBased LLC App, the operation of which is detailed below (see
        Section 3). 2.2. Independence The Publisher has no contractual or
        financial ties of any kind with the producers and/or distributors of the
        Products evaluated by the App, which is completely independent: the
        StrictlyBased LLC App does not display any advertising, no brand or
        industrial group can influence the analysis of its products, nor
        remunerate the Publisher for highlighting these products on the App or
        on the blog, the Publisher does not exploit or sell any user data. The
        Publisher is financed by three sources of revenue: the paid Premium
        Version of the App, the sale of StrictlyBased LLC’s “Healthy Eating
        Guide”, which presents all the basics of healthy eating in an
        educational and accessible way (unavailable in USA), the sale of
        StrictlyBased LLC’s Seasonal Fruits and Vegetables Calendar (unavailable
        in USA). To further enhance transparency, the Publisher has made its
        balance sheet and sales breakdown publicly available. 3. How the App
        works 3.1. Database StrictlyBased LLC has its own Database, which
        contains several million food and cosmetic products (the “Products”).
        This Database is currently supplied by: 1) Contributions from Users (the
        “Contributors”), who can add Products not listed by StrictlyBased LLC
        directly via the App, by adding photos of the Products and information
        about their composition. 2) Brands that give StrictlyBased LLC access to
        information about their products. This information corresponds to the
        mandatory information on product labels. There is therefore no conflict
        of interest when StrictlyBased LLC works with brands to improve the
        provision of this information. There are three (free) solutions for
        this: the StrictlyBased LLC database, our data import tool, the Salsify
        platform with which we collaborate. The Publisher does not guarantee the
        complete reliability of the information regarding the composition of the
        Products listed in the Database, nor the complete detection of
        ingredients (see Section 6.3.1 below). In fact, the information provided
        by the App relays the information on the Products’ label. The Publisher
        has set up control systems which enable its team to verify this
        information, but the Publisher itself does not analyze the composition
        of the Products. Errors of composition or detection may occur. 3.2.
        Rating method The application operates on a basis of evaluating
        ingredients and grouping the scanned product into one of three
        categories. The first category is the “Based” category, products are
        placed within this category if the ingredients that they contain are
        evaluated by our algorithm as being healthy. If the product’s
        ingredients do not pass our algorithmic testing, then it is placed into
        the “Not Based” Category. If the product’s ingredients are not able to
        be read, then the item is placed in the “Unknown” category.
        StrictlyBased LLC claims that none of our recommendations are medically
        accurate, this is all meant to be a tool at the user’s discretion to
        enable them to have a more informed food purchasing experience. 3.3.
        StrictlyBased LLC evaluations and opinions The Score, which is
        calculated by the algorithm and assigned by the App, constitutes an
        opinion based on the analysis of the ingredients and additives that make
        up the Products. The terms “Based” “Not Based” refer only to the Score
        of the Product, according to the evaluation method developed by the
        Publisher. These terms do not refer to the product itself or to its
        intrinsic qualities (for example, the term “bad” does not mean that a
        Product is unfit for consumption). Similarly, the terms “at risk,”
        “moderate risk,” “limited risk,” “low risk,” “no risk,” “very high
        impact,” “high impact,” “moderate impact,” “low impact,” “very low
        impact” refer solely to the Publisher’s opinion about the additives or
        components contained in the Products, based on the analysis of solid
        scientific studies. The User must therefore be aware of the complexity
        of the fields of nutrition, cosmetics and environmental analysis. The
        App provides an initial analysis that enables consumers to be more aware
        of the composition of the food and cosmetic products they use on a daily
        basis, but does not guarantee the User better health. One’s state of
        health is determined by numerous factors, including lifestyle and
        environment (a healthy and balanced diet, physical exercise, hygiene,
        the absence of problems caused by addictions, stress or pollution). The
        Services offered by the App do not in any way constitute a medical
        recommendation. The evaluation of the Product, as expressed by the
        Score, does not constitute a judgement on the Product’s health or
        environmental properties, and factors cannot be disregarded, in
        particular those linked to the quantity of product consumed, the
        frequency with which it is consumed, the lifestyle and environment
        described above. The Publisher’s aim in evaluating the Products is
        neither to prohibit nor to promote the Products, but to make as many
        consumers as possible aware of the composition of these Products. 3.4.
        Recommendations and rankings When a Product with a “Poor” or “Bad” Score
        is scanned by a User, StrictlyBased LLC suggests similar products which
        have a higher score (“Good” or “Excellent”). The recommendations are
        selected in a totally neutral and objective way: there are no brands
        that pay or influence StrictlyBased LLC to appear in the
        recommendations. The algorithm for selecting healthier alternatives
        takes the following into account, in order of priority: 1) Product
        category (e.g., strawberry jams, plain goat’s and sheep’s milk yogurts,
        non-tinted lip balms, solid soaps, etc.) in order to recommend a product
        as close as possible to the initial product. 2) Product availability, in
        order to recommend products that can be found easily. 3) Product rating,
        in order to specifically recommend highly rated products, i.e. “Good” or
        “Excellent.” The App also offers Product rankings (or “top products”),
        which are accessible free of charge, but currently only in France and
        the United States. As with the recommendations, the selection of
        products featured in the rankings is completely impartial. There are no
        brands that remunerate StrictlyBased LLC to be featured in these
        rankings. The ranking selection algorithm takes into account the
        following criteria: 1) Product category, in order to be as close as
        possible to the selected category. 2) Product availability in the
        country, so that products can be found easily. 3) Product score, in
        descending order. 4) The number of Products of the same brand is
        limited, in order to promote a diversified product representation and to
        avoid excessive presence of the same brand. Top products may include
        products with a score of less than 50/100 if no product in the category
        has a higher score, but products containing red additives (classified as
        “hazardous” in the app) are systematically excluded. 3.6. Premium
        Version The App offers the in-app purchase of a Premium Version which
        includes the following features: an “Offline” mode: allows to scan and
        access a product's grade even without an Internet connection. This
        feature does not cover all of the Products listed, but only a selection
        (representing the most frequently scanned Products). the “Search”
        feature: enables the User to search the Products’ database by using
        keywords (product name, brand, etc.) and to access to its Score, without
        having to scan the product in question. the “Food Preferences” features:
        enables the User to customize the App according to preference and
        dietary restrictions. The App highlights the presence of unwanted
        ingredients in the product sheet, and the recommendations then take
        those preferences into account. 4. Account in the App 4.1. Creating an
        account Users who create an account in the App may access their account
        by logging in with the username and password provided at the time of
        registration and by using systems such as third-party social media
        log-in buttons. By registering, the User agrees to respect the following
        conditions: accounts created by bots or other automated methods are not
        permitted; unless expressly authorized, each User may register only one
        account; unless expressly authorized, a User account may not be shared
        with others. Users are fully responsible for protecting the passwords
        they have chosen. They are encouraged to use complex passwords. If they
        forget their passwords, they can choose a new password. This password
        guarantees the confidentiality of the information contained in the
        User’s account, and the User is therefore prohibited from transmitting
        or communicating it to a third party. Otherwise, the Publisher may not
        be held liable for unauthorized access to a User’s account. Users who
        have reason to believe that their personal usernames and passwords have
        been improperly disclosed or violated must inform the Publisher
        immediately, by using the contact details provided in the Preamble to
        the Terms and Conditions. 4.2. Suspension or deletion of an account by
        the Publisher The Publisher reserves the exclusive and discretionary
        right to suspend access to the App or to delete the account of any User
        who has violated these Terms and Conditions (in particular, but not
        limited to, the restrictions on use and publication, set out in Section
        5.1 and following of these Terms and Conditions, and the Call-out User
        Policy). The Publisher may also delete any account that has been
        inactive for at least one year. Such suspension or deletion, which may
        occur at any time and without prior notice, shall not be liable to
        constitute damage to the excluded User, who shall therefore not be
        entitled to claim any compensation as a result. The suspension or
        deletion of an account is not exclusive of the Publisher’s right to take
        legal action against the User where the facts justify such an action.
        4.3. Closure by the User Each User is free to close their account on the
        App. To do so, the User must send an email to the Publisher indicating
        the wish to delete their account. The User may also follow the deletion
        procedure. 5. Rights and obligations of the User 5.1. Restrictions on
        use and publication of content on StrictlyBased LLC The User agrees to
        comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as with these Terms
        and Conditions, and in particular with the following restrictions: not
        to publish any illegal content via the Website or the App, in
        particular: o defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing or otherwise
        inappropriate content; o content that directly or indirectly promotes
        hatred, racism, discrimination, pornography, violence or any other
        violation of human dignity; not to interfere with the proper functioning
        of StrictlyBased LLC, in particular not to: o probe, scan or test
        StrictlyBased LLC’s vulnerabilities; o violate StrictlyBased LLC’s
        security and authentication measures; o install, integrate, download or
        otherwise incorporate any malware into or through StrictlyBased LLC; o
        use StrictlyBased LLC in an abusive, excessive or otherwise
        inappropriate manner (for example, to send spam); o attempt to disrupt
        or tamper with the technical infrastructure in a way that adversely
        affects StrictlyBased LLC; o adopt any automated procedure to harvest or
        scrape data and/or content from StrictlyBased LLC. not to infringe the
        rights of other Users, in particular not to: o hijack any account used
        by another User; o harvest or collect any information about other Users,
        such as their login details and other personal data; make personal and
        non-commercial use of the data relayed by the App, in particular: o not
        to use the evaluations, recommendations and rankings provided by the App
        for personal gain or for profit; not to add or modify product
        composition/ingredients erroneously, under the conditions described
        below. Users who fail to comply with the restrictions set out in this
        section will have their accounts suspended or deleted, in accordance
        with the conditions set out in Section 4.2. 5.2. Adding products Users
        have the ability to contribute to the content accessible via the App by
        adding or editing data relating to food and cosmetic Products.
        Contributors waive their rights to the content of the contributions, in
        favor of the Publisher, for any distribution or use, including of a
        commercial nature. Contributors are informed that the Publisher may
        publish all or part of the contribution (for food products only) on the
        Open Food Facts website (openfoodfacts.org). Contributors undertake to
        provide truthful information when making a contribution and to comply
        with the rules of contribution. The Contributor undertakes to relay only
        information and photographs for which the Contributor owns the
        intellectual property rights. The Contributor undertakes not to add
        information and/or photographs from other websites. The information
        added by the Contributor must come directly from the product packaging.
        Any photographs added by the Contributor must have been taken by the
        Contributor. 5.3. Making changes to Product information The User who has
        identified missing or inaccurate information is invited to edit the
        product data sheet. The User may also report an error to the Publisher,
        who will make its best efforts to update the Database within a
        reasonable time. Any Contributor who deliberately deletes correct
        information and/or deliberately enters incorrect information will have
        their account suspended or deleted under the conditions set out in
        Section 4.2, and legal action may be taken against the Contributor. Such
        contributions may be immediately deleted by the Publisher. 5.4.
        Responsibility of the User and Contributor Contributors are solely
        responsible for the content they publish. The Publisher expressly
        reserves the right to take legal action against a Contributor in the
        event that the Publisher suffers damage resulting from a Contributor’s
        contributions which do not comply with these Terms and Conditions, or
        against a User who has violated these Terms and Conditions. The User
        hereby agrees to hold harmless, defend and indemnify, to the fullest
        extent permitted by law, the Publisher and its officers, directors,
        representatives, agents, consultants, contractors and employees, from
        and against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses
        (including reasonable attorneys’ and consultants’ fees and
        disbursements) incurred by the Publisher as a result of any claim by a
        third party (including government agencies and authorities) arising out
        of, based upon or resulting from your breach of these Terms and
        Conditions. The responsibility of the User in the context of Call-outs
        is detailed in the Call-out User Policy. 6. Exclusion and limitation of
        liability and warranties of the Publisher 6.1. Access to the App The
        Publisher hereby informs you that the information entered in the App is
        hosted on the servers of an external service provider to whom the
        Publisher has subcontracted the hosting service. The Publisher shall not
        be held liable for any technical unavailability of the connection,
        whether due to (but not limited to) force majeure, maintenance,
        updating, modification, intervention by the host, internal or external
        strikes, network failures or power outages. The User acknowledges to be
        aware of the limitations and constraints specific to the Internet
        network and, as such, recognizes in particular the impossibility of a
        total guarantee of the security of data exchanges. The Publisher cannot
        be held liable for any damage resulting from the use of the App, such as
        loss of data, intrusion, viruses, service disruptions, and the like. The
        Publisher shall not be held liable in the event of misuse, incorrect
        configuration of the User’s device driver, or use of a device driver
        that is rarely used by the User or is obsolete. The total or partial
        impossibility of using the Website or the App, in particular due to
        hardware incompatibility, shall not give rise to any compensation,
        reimbursement or liability on the part of the Publisher. 6.2. Access to
        external resources Through StrictlyBased LLC, the User may have access
        to external resources provided by third parties, such as links to
        scientific studies in the “Scientific Sources” section. The User is
        informed that these external resources are governed by the terms and
        conditions or other legally binding documents established by their
        owner. The User acknowledges and accepts that the Publisher has no
        control over such resources and shall not be liable for their content or
        (un)availability. The Publisher shall not be held liable if the content
        of external resources violates current legislation or if their use by
        the User causes harm. 6.3. Content displayed on the StrictlyBased LLC
        App THE APP PROVIDES THE USER WITH DATA OF AN INDICATIVE AND GENERAL
        NATURE. THE PUBLISHER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RELEVANCE, ACCURACY OR
        COMPLETENESS OF THE DATA DISPLAYED ON THE APP, WHICH IS PROVIDED “AS IS”
        AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE ABOVE, THE
        PUBLISHER EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO EVALUATION OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
        OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHER THROUGH ITS SERVICES, THE WEBSITE OR THE
        APP, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE IN THIS TERMS AND
        CONDITIONS OR CREATE ANY LIABILITY FOR THE PUBLISHER. USERS EXPRESSLY
        AGREE TO USE THE APP AT THEIR OWN RISK AND UNDER THEIR SOLE
        RESPONSIBILITY. THE USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING AND
        PURCHASING A PRODUCT. THE APP DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE, AND IS IN
        NO WAY INTENDED TO REPLACE A CONSULTATION WITH A HEALTHCARE
        PROFESSIONAL, IN PARTICULAR A DIETICIAN OR DOCTOR. THE USER MUST NEVER
        USE THE APP FOR MEDICAL REASONS, AND IN PARTICULAR MUST NEVER NEGLECT OR
        DELAY SEEKING MEDICAL ADVICE OR PROFESSIONAL CARE IN THE EVENT OF A
        HEALTH PROBLEM, AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THE USER HAS READ ON THE APP.
        THE CONTENT ON THE APP MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR PERSONS WHO HAVE EVER
        EXPERIENCED EATING DISORDERS. 6.3.1. Information about product
        composition – Database The Publisher does not guarantee the accuracy or
        completeness of its analysis of the composition of the Products. The
        Publisher shall not be liable for the data relating to the composition
        of the Products analyzed and excludes all liability in the event of
        errors in the Database. The Database evolves according to the products
        added and/or modified by the Contributors and the Publisher, on the
        basis of the information provided by the manufacturers. Errors of
        composition or detection may occur. It is therefore the responsibility
        of Users to check the composition of the Products directly on the
        product packaging, to ensure that they have up-to-date information
        regarding the composition of the Products. 6.3.2. Evaluation of the
        risks of ingredients and additives contained in the Products The
        Publisher does not guarantee the relevance, completeness or accuracy of
        the risk evaluations associated with the ingredients and additives
        contained in the Products. The Publisher does not claim to have any
        scientific authority and only issues opinions about the potential risks
        associated with ingredients and additives in the Products, based on an
        analysis of collective expert reports (including independent studies)
        and scientific studies from recognized institutions and applicable
        regulations. The Publisher applies the precautionary principle and warns
        of the presence of certain ingredients and additives, even if the risk
        is still suspected rather than proven. The Publisher makes every effort
        to provide an analysis based on the current state of science.
        Nevertheless, given the number of ingredients and additives contained in
        the Products evaluated by the Publisher, the inclusion of the most
        recent scientific studies and regulatory changes cannot be guaranteed.
        The Publisher cannot be held liable if the evaluation of an additive or
        ingredient which poses a risk does not take into account a recent change
        in regulations, for example, at the local level in a US State. 6.3.3.
        Product recommendations and rankings STRICLTY BASED LLC ("Company,"
        "we," "our," "us") provides an app designed to offer general guidance on
        food products, including whether they are classified as "healthy" or not
        based on available data. However, the content and recommendations
        provided through our app are for informational purposes only and should
        not be construed as professional advice, medical recommendations, or
        endorsements of any particular food product. Accuracy and Liability
        Disclaimer: While we strive to provide accurate, up-to-date information,
        we make no representations or warranties about the accuracy,
        completeness, or suitability of the information provided. All product
        rankings, health assessments, and food classifications are based on the
        data available to us at the time and may not reflect changes in
        formulations, ingredients, or nutritional values. No Endorsement or
        Medical Advice: STRICLTY BASED LLC does not endorse or promote any
        specific food products, brands, or manufacturers. Users should always
        consult a qualified healthcare professional or nutritionist before
        making dietary changes based on the information provided by the app. The
        app's classification of food products as "healthy" or "unhealthy" is
        subjective and intended only as a general guideline, and users should
        not solely rely on this information when making food choices. No
        Liability for Defamation or Misrepresentation: STRICLTY BASED LLC is not
        liable for any defamation, misrepresentation, or damages resulting from
        reliance on the app's food classifications or rankings. We disclaim any
        responsibility for the outcomes of food-related decisions made by users
        based on the information presented by the app. By using the app, users
        agree to hold STRICLTY BASED LLC harmless from any and all claims,
        damages, or losses that may arise from such use. 6.3.4. Specific
        features of the Premium Version The Publisher shall not be liable for
        the unavailability of a Product in the offline Database, which contains
        only a portion of the Products (representing the most frequently scanned
        Products). For the reasons set out above regarding the impossibility of
        guaranteeing data relating to the composition of the Products, the
        Publisher cannot guarantee the relevance, completeness and accuracy of
        information relating to the “Food preferences” chosen by the User. This
        feature should therefore not be used by people who have severe allergies
        that could lead to serious medical complications. In all cases, it is
        the User’s responsibility to check the composition of the Products
        directly on the packaging, to ensure that these Products do not contain
        any ingredient to which the User is intolerant or does not wish to
        consume. 6.4. General limitation of liability OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION
        WITH PUBLISHER’S AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT YOU AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN
        ARTICLE 3 OF THE CALL-OUT USER POLICY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY LAW, THE PUBLISHER’S ENTITIES SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
        DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
        WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, LOST
        PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST CUSTOMERS OR LOST DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR
        IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE APP, WHETHER
        BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
        AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THE PUBLISHER’S ENTITIES HAS BEEN INFORMED OF
        THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE. OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH PUBLISHER’S
        AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT YOU AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 3 OF THE
        CALL-OUT USER POLICY THE PUBLISHER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO USERS
        ARISING OUT OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE
        APP, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER
        LEGAL THEORY, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT THE USER HAS PAID FOR THE
        YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION OF THE PREMIUM VERSION OR, IN CASE OF USE OF THE
        FREE VERSION OF THE APP, TO US$100. AS SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION
        AND LIMITATION DO NOT APPLY TO USERS RESIDING IN THESE STATES. IN SUCH
        STATES, THE PUBLISHER’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        LAW, THEREBY MINIMIZING THE PUBLISHER’S LIABILITY TO THE LOWEST AMOUNT
        PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 7. Intellectual property rights 7.1. The

        price shown on the App and the Website on the day of purchase will be
        the only price applicable to the Customer. 8.3. Payment methods 8.3.1.
        Purchases via a Store The Customer may place an order for the Premium
        Version on the App and pay for it using the payment method whose details
        the Customer has provided to the Store. The Customer is hereby informed
        that purchases made through the Store are subject to the Store’s Terms
        and Conditions, which shall prevail over these Terms and Conditions in
        the event of any conflict. 8.3.2. Purchases via the Website The Customer
        may also place an order via the Website. Orders placed via the Website
        can currently only be paid for by credit card. 8.3.3. Common provisions

        reimbursement. The User will continue to have access to the Premium
        Version until the end of the subscription period. Users may terminate
        their subscriptions either through the Store via which they subscribed
        to the Premium Version, or by sending an email to the contact email
        (team@StrictlyBased LLC.io) 9. General provisions 9.1. Modification of
        the Terms and Conditions The Publisher reserves the right to modify

        Users are encouraged to regularly consult the Terms and Conditions on
        the Website. The changes made will only take effect within a period of
        14 days after being posted online. If the User continues to use the

        the User may not continue to use the Services. The User may contact the
        Publisher for any request concerning a previous version of the Terms and
        Conditions. 9.2. Severability and nullity If one or more clauses of
        these Terms and Conditions are found to be invalid or declared as such
        in application of a law, regulation or following a final decision of a
        competent court, the other clauses shall retain their full force and
        scope. 9.3. Tolerance The User acknowledges that the Publisher’s
        tolerance of a situation does not confer any rights on the User. The
        Publisher’s failure to assert any right or provision shall not be
        construed as a waiver of these rights or provisions. 10. Disputes;
        Governing law For any problem or dispute that you may have with
        StrictlyBased LLC, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give
        StrictlyBased LLC an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.
        This includes you first sending a written statement to StrictlyBased LLC
        that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party
        giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and a proposed solution
        (such statement, a “Notice of Dispute”). You must send any Notice of
        Dispute by email to team@StrictlyBased LLC.io or by first class U.S.
        mail, return receipt requested to StrictlyBased LLC at 14102 maplewood
        court, libertyville, IL 60048 USA Attn: Notice of Dispute. You then
        agree to negotiate with StrictlyBased LLC in good faith about your
        problem or dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some
        reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within
        sixty (60) days after StrictlyBased LLC’s receipt of your Notice of
        Dispute, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
        10.1. Binding Arbitration If you and StrictlyBased LLC do not resolve
        any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the
        dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as
        described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or
        participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before
        a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral
        arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of
        appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction
        over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award. IF APPLICABLE LAW
        DOES NOT ALLOW BINDING ARBITRATION TO APPLY TO YOU, THE ABOVE PROVISION
        WILL APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        10.2. Class-action waiver Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any
        dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
        Neither you nor StrictlyBased LLC will seek to have any dispute heard as
        a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or
        proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or
        proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written
        consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. IF
        APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION PROCEEDINGS TO
        APPLY TO YOU, THE ABOVE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST
        EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 10.3 Arbitration procedures Any
        arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association
        (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You agree to
        commence arbitration only in the State of New York. You may request a
        telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute
        involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the
        arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The
        arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court
        could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to
        you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your
        individual claim. Claims or disputes must be filed within one year. To
        the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement
        must be filed within one year in small claims court, or in an
        arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or
        Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute is not
        filed within one year, it is permanently barred. Right to Opt Out. IF
        YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST
        NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST RECEIVE
        THIS AGREEMENT BY EMAIL TO team@StrictlyBased LLC.io OR BY FIRST CLASS

        Maplewood Court, Libertyville, IL 60048 USA ATTN: ARBITRATION. YOUR
        WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO StrictlyBased LLC MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND
        ADDRESS AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE
        DISPUTES WITH StrictlyBased LLC THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO
        OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON
        YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH StrictlyBased LLC OR THE DELIVERY OF ANY
        SERVICE(S) TO YOU BY Strictly Based. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED
        StrictlyBased LLC OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT
        NEED TO DO SO AGAIN. This Section survives expiration or termination of
        these Terms and Conditions for any reason. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ITS TERMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
        IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO
        ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES. For any matters which are not subject to
        arbitration as set forth in these Terms and Conditions and/or in
        connection with the entering of any judgment on an arbitration award in
        connection with these Terms and Conditions, you irrevocably submit and
        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal
        courts located in or New York County, New York. You agree not to raise
        the defense of forum non conveniens.
